Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming that allow the execution of different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. In most programming languages, the common types of conditional statements are "if," "else if" (or "elif"), and "else."

let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}



let x = 3;

if (x % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("x is even");
} else {
    console.log("x is odd");
}
